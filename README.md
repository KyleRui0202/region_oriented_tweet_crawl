Region-Oriented Tweet Crawl Toolkit
=========
This toolkit is used to crawl tweet data using two Twitter REST APIs: GET search/tweets and GET users/search.

**_This toolkit assumes the following:_**

* You know how OAuth works for Twitter APIs
* You are using Python 2.7
* You have rights and know how to install Python libraries.

## Installation

First, clone this repo to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/KyleRui0202/region_oriented_tweet_crawl.git
```

Next, make sure to install the required Python package "twitter". We use pip to install it:

```
pip install twitter
```

You may also install it from its GitGub repository: https://github.com/sixohsix/twitter.git. You can learn more about pip [here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip).
